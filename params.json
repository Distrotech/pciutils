See http://www.gnu.org/ for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. What's that?\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe PCI Utilities package contains a library for portable access to PCI bus\r\nconfiguration registers and several utilities based on this library.\r\n\r\nIn runs on the following systems:\r\n\r\n\tLinux\t\t(via /sys/bus/pci, /proc/bus/pci or i386 ports)\r\n\tFreeBSD\t\t(via /dev/pci)\r\n\tNetBSD\t\t(via libpci)\r\n\tOpenBSD\t\t(via /dev/pci)\r\n\tGNU/kFreeBSD\t(via /dev/pci)\r\n\tSolaris/i386\t(direct port access)\r\n\tAix\t\t(via /dev/pci and odmget)\r\n\tGNU Hurd\t(direct port access)\r\n\tWindows\t\t(direct port access)\r\n\tCYGWIN\t\t(direct port access)\r\n\tBeOS\t\t(via syscalls)\r\n\tHaiku\t\t(via /dev/misc/poke)\r\n\r\nIt should be very easy to add support for other systems as well (volunteers\r\nwanted; if you want to try that, I'll be very glad to see the patches and\r\ninclude them in the next version).\r\n\r\nThe utilities include:  (See manual pages for more details)\r\n\r\n  - lspci: displays detailed information about all PCI buses and devices.\r\n\r\n  - setpci: allows to read from and write to PCI device configuration\r\n    registers. For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it.\r\n    CAUTION: There is a couple of dangerous points and caveats, please read\r\n    the manual page first!\r\n\r\n  - update-pciids: download the current version of the pci.ids file.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Compiling and (un)installing\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nJust run \"make\" to compile the package and then \"make install\" to install it.\r\nPlease note that GNU make is needed on most platforms.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the default installation location, please override\r\nthe PREFIX variable specified in the Makefile -- e.g., you can use\r\n\"make PREFIX=/opt/pciutils install\" to create a separate installation\r\nnot interfering with the rest of your system.  Setting the DESTDIR variable\r\nwill allow you to install to a different directory from the one you intend\r\nto eventually run it from.  This is useful for people who are packaging\r\npciutils to install on other computers.\r\n\r\nThere are several options which can be set in the Makefile or overridden\r\nwhen running make:\r\n\r\n  ZLIB=yes/no\tEnable support for compressed pci.ids (requires zlib).\r\n\t\tIf it is enabled, pciutils will use pci.ids.gz in preference to\r\n\t\tpci.ids, even if the pci.ids file is newer.  If the pci.ids.gz\r\n\t\tfile is missing, it will use pci.ids instead.  If you do not\r\n\t\tspecify this option, the configure script will try to guess\r\n\t\tautomatically based on the presence of zlib.\r\n\r\n  DNS=yes/no\tEnable support for querying the central database of PCI IDs\r\n\t\tusing DNS.  Requires libresolv (which is available on most\r\n\t\tsystems as a part of the standard libraries) and tries to\r\n\t\tautodetect its presence if the option is not specified.\r\n\r\n  SHARED=yes/\tBuild libpci as a shared library.  Requires GCC 4.0 or newer.\r\n  no/local\tThe ABI of the shared library is intended to remain backward\r\n\t\tcompatible for a long time (we use symbol versioning to achieve\r\n\t\tthat, like GNU libc does).  The value `local' includes the\r\n\t\tright directory name in the binaries, so the utilities can be\r\n\t\trun without installation.  This is not recommended for any\r\n\t\tproduction builds.\r\n\r\n\"make install-lib\" installs the library together with its header files\r\nfor use by other programs.\r\n\r\nWhen you are bored of dumping PCI registers, just use \"make uninstall\".\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Getting new IDs\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe database of PCI IDs (the pci.ids file) gets out of date much faster\r\nthan I release new versions of this package, so it is maintained separately.\r\n\r\nIt lives at http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/, where you can browse the database,\r\ndownload the most recent pci.ids file (e.g., by running the update-ids utility)\r\nand also submit new entries.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use `lspci -q' to query the central database\r\nfor new entries via network.\r\n\r\nThe pci.ids file is also mirrored at http://pciids.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Getting new versions\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe current version of pciutils is available at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://mj.ucw.cz/sw/pciutils/\r\n\r\nThe tarball can be downloaded at the following places:\r\n\r\n\tftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/pci/\r\n\tftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/pciutils/ (expect a couple of hours delay)\r\n\tftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/hardware/ (expect a couple of days delay)\r\n\r\nThere is also a public GIT tree at:\r\n\r\n\tgit://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/pciutils/pciutils.git\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Using the library\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nSo far, there is only a little documentation for the library except for the\r\ngeneral introduction in the pcilib(7) man page. If you want to use the\r\nlibrary in your programs, please follow the comments in lib/pci.h and in\r\nthe example program example.c.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Feedback\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nIf you have any bug reports or suggestions, send them to the author.\r\n\r\nIf you have any new IDs, I'll be very glad to add them to the database.\r\nJust submit them at http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/.\r\n\r\nAnnouncements of new versions are sent to linux-pci@vger.kernel.org\r\n(see http://vger.kernel.org/ for instructions).\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHave fun\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMartin\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
